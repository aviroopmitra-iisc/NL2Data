A retail company operates an e-commerce platform with the following structure:

The company manages multiple products, each with a Product ID, Name, Category, and Price.
Products are sold through multiple orders. Each order has an Order ID, Customer ID, Order Date, and Total Amount.
Customers are identified by Customer ID, Name, Email, and Registration Date.
Each order contains multiple order items, with Order ID, Product ID, Quantity, and Unit Price.

The system should support:
- 1 million orders
- 100,000 products
- 500,000 customers
- Product IDs should follow a Zipf distribution (popular products are ordered more frequently)
- Orders should show seasonal patterns (higher sales in December and November)
- Customer registration dates should be uniformly distributed over the past 3 years
